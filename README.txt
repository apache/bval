Apache Bean Validation (incubating) - README.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About
=====
This is an implementation of JSR 303 (Bean Validation), a specification of the
Java API for Javabean validation in Java EE and Java SE.
The technical objective is to provide a class level constraint declaration and
validation facility for the Java application developer, as well as a constraint
metadata repository and query API.


Disclaimer
==========
Apache Bean Validation is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required
of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a
manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is
not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it
does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
