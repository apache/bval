Overview
========
This is an implementation of JSR 303 (Bean Validation), a specification of the
Java API for Javabean validation in Java EE and Java SE.
The technical objective is to provide a class level constraint declaration and
validation facility for the Java application developer, as well as a constraint
metadata repository and query API.

This implementation is based on the validation framework of agimatec GmbH,
which was contributed to the ASF under a software grant.


Disclaimer
==========
Apache BVal is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required
of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a
manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is
not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it
does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.


Prerequisites
=============
You need a platform that supports Java SE 5 or later.


Documentation
=============
Please refer to the project page at:
    http://incubator.apache.org/bval/


Getting Involved
================
The Apache BVal project is being built by the open source community
for the open source community - we welcome your input and contributions!

What are we looking for?
  * Source code and fixes contributions
  * Documentation assistance
  * Project and feature suggestions
  * Integration and testing with other projects
  * Detailed and constructive feedback
  * Articles and whitepapers

How do I Contribute?
  * To discuss BVal topics, check out the mailing lists.
  * Bugs and other issues can be posted on the project JIRA.
